      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way

      newPlayers = players.slice();
      newPlayers[3] = "Tom";

      console.log(players, newPlayers);
      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      let newPlayers1 = [].concat(players);
      newPlayers1[3] = "Harry";

      console.log(players, newPlayers1);
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      let newPlayers2 = [...players];
      newPlayers2[3] = "Dick";

      console.log(players, newPlayers2);

      let newPlayers3 = Array.from(players);
      newPlayers3[3] = "Pony";

      console.log(players, newPlayers3);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      let newPerson = { ...person };
      newPerson.number = 1;
      newPerson.age = 41;
      console.log(person, newPerson);

      let newPerson1 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 2, age: 34 });
      console.log(person, newPerson1);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
